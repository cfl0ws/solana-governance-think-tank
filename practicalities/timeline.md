# Introduction

It is expected that implementing a Solana governance process will happen gradually, in phases.

## Timeline

### Phase 0 - Initial Planning Phase

July 2023 - December 2023

This phase will define the initial governance process implementation that will happen in Phase 1.

Milestones

- End of September 2023, present the How section for comment to the Solana Governance Think Tank
- End of October 2023, present updated Who, What and How sections at the Block 0 validator conference and possibly at Breakpoint

### Phase 1 - Implementation Phase #1

The initial implementation of the Solana governance process will take place during this Phase 1. It will be a contained, scope limited implementation, with the focus being on a process contained enough to take the first step toward implementing the larger process over time.
