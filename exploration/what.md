# What

## Introduction

An initial, incomplete list of types of governance decisions that may exist in an L1 environment such as Solana:

* Protocol-altering technical changes
  * Major
  * Minor
* Economic changes (e.g. inflation)
* Possibly community fund spending
* Changes to governance itself

Initially minor protocol-altering technical changes should likely not fall under governance, e.g. altering the account of a native program or a SYSVAR to accommodate more data as part of a performance or feature enhancement.

Major protocol changes as well as economic changes should likely fall under governance.

Whether a community fund should or will exist is a further debate. The Solana Foundation administers an ecosystem fund, and there is a case to be made that some portion of this should potentially be made available for administration through governance, e.g. for grants or other development that the community wishes to decide on, independent of the Foundation.

## Key Questions

### What is the scope of the governance process?

The community first needs to decide what topics should be voted on. This then helps inform the "[Who should be voting?](https://github.com/laine-sa/solana-governance-think-tank/blob/master/exploration/who.md)" question. These two questions are very tightly bound to each other.

### How should the scope be broken into phases?

One way to approach this is to think about a phased approach. Phase 0 is the current planning phase. Phase 1 can be looked at as the first active phase of the governance process. Taking this approach allows the community to think about limiting the scope of Phase 1, understanding this will be a learning process and one that it iterated on over time.

## Current Working Proposal

The current working proposal continues returning to the validator client code. This can be thought about from perspectives such as - 

* What features get implemented and when?
* What code gets adopted on the network, when and by what criteria is the decision made. e.g. sufficient code audits have been completed?

One suggestion to futher contain the scope is to limit Phase 1 scope to any code implementation that includes an economic consideration.
